# Here are the configuration descriptions for the scroll tool
# 
# The "tools: bind:" setting is specified in greater detail
#  in the config.yml file
# 
# tools: scroll: override: <true|false>
#    By default there are only certain types of materials that can
#    be scrolled. If you want to allow your users to only access a
#    subset of those items, enable the override, and set the desired
#    materials in the below list
# 
# tools: scroll: allow: [ <id>, ...]
#    If the above override is set, only materials that are listed
#    here and are supported by the scroll tool will scroll for users.

  bind:
    scroll: 352 # BONE
