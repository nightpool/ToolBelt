# Here are the configuration descriptions for the dupe tool
# 
# The "tools: bind:" setting is specified in greater detail
#  in the config.yml file
# 
# tools: dupe: replace: <id>: <id>
#    This gives additional mappings of what a duplicated block
#    should give the player. For instance, 7: 260 means that when
#    a user tries to duplicate bedrock, they get apples instead.
#    If you want to override the default replacement, just redefine
#    it here.
# 
# tools: dupe: keepData: [<id>, ...]
#    This tells the tool what items should keep their data value.
#    Do not change this unless you understand data values, and what
#    they mean when items in your hand have data values.
#    SUGGESTION: If a value above is 'replace'd, remove it from
#        the keepData field as well.
