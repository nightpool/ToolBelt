# Here are the configuration descriptions for the Pickhax tool
# 
# The "tools: bind:" and "tools: global: *:" settings are
#  specified in greater detail in the config.yml file
# 
# tools: phax: range: <Number of blocks>
#    Setting this to a non-zero value allows users of the PickHax
#    to break a block from a distance. After a certain distance, it
#    is hard to be accurate. In order to use the PickHax at
#    range, if permissions are enabled, as user must have:
#        toolbelt.tool.phax.range
# 
# tools: phax: onlyAllow:  <[]|[ <id>, ...]>
#    Read the tools.global.onlyAllow help in config.yml for details.
#    If the value is non-zero, it overwrites the .global. setting.
# 
# tools: phax: stopOverwrite:  [ <id>, ...]
#    Read the tools.global.stopOverwrite help in config.yml.
#    If the value is non-zero, it overwrites the .global. setting.
