# Here are the configuration descriptions for the leap tool
# 
# The "tools: bind:" setting is specified in greater detail
#  in the config.yml file
# 
# tools: leap: thrust: <Number for height of vertical thrust>
#    This changes how much the user gets pushed when looking
#    nearly straight down. Might be tweaked in the future for
#    broader control.
# 
# tools: leap: cruise: <Number for height to cruise at>
#    When looking nearly directly at the horizon this is what
#    altitude you will approximately fly at.
# 
# tools: leap: teleport: <true|false>
#    This changes the way that a user leaps when they crouch.
#    Instead of a graceful leap, they will instead teleport
#    in the direction they would have leapt. Because this has
#    the possibility to get through obstacles the user should
#    be blocked by, it has a separate permission node:
#    toolbelt.tool.leap.tel
# 
# tools: leap: invuln: <Number of seconds>
#    This controls how long the user of the leap tool is
#    protected from fall damage after using the leap tool. By
#    default, as long as the user has permission to use the
#    leap tool and is holding it, they don't have fall damage
#    at all. This is defined by having a negative value (-1).
#    Setting this to zero will remove all protection from fall
#    damage, and setting it to any other positive number will
#    protect them from fall damage for that length of time.
#    (Suggested value is 10 seconds if you want limited
#    invulnerability)
