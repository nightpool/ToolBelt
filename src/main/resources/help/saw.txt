# Here are the configuration descriptions for the Chainsaw tool
# 
# The "tools: bind:" and "tools: global: *:" settings are
#  specified in greater detail in the config.yml file
# 
# tools: saw: widthCube: <Number for width of cube>
#    This number should be odd as it is centered around the clicked
#    block. Even numbers will be rounded down one.
# 
# tools: saw: radiusSphere: <Number for radius of sphere>
#    This number can have fractional components, this will alter
#    the type of disk produced. Note that this specifies the radius
#    and not diameter of the disk.
# 
# tools: saw: onlyAllow:  <[]|[ <id>, ...]>
#    Read the tools.global.onlyAllow help in config.yml for details.
#    If the value is non-zero, it overwrites the .global. setting.
#    For the saw we default to logs, leaves and vines.
# 
# tools: saw: stopOverwrite:  [ <id>, ...]
#    Read the tools.global.stopOverwrite help in config.yml.
#    If the value is non-zero, it overwrites the .global. setting.
