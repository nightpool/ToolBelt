# Here are the configuration descriptions for the Shovel tool
# 
# The "tools: bind:" and "tools: global: *:" settings are
#  specified in greater detail in the config.yml file
# 
# tools: shovel: widthCube: <Number for width of cube>
#    This number should be odd as it is centered around the clicked
#    block. Even numbers will be rounded down one.
# 
# tools: shovel: radiusDisk: <Number for radius of disk>
#    This number can have fractional components, this will alter
#    the type of disk produced. This only changes the x and z
#    components, as the disk is always one block high. Note that
#    this specifies the radius and not diameter of the disk.
# 
# tools: shovel: radiusSphere: <Number for radius of sphere>
#    Same as for the disk, except also has a y component.
# 
# tools: shovel: onlyAllow:  <[]|[ <id>, ...]>
#    Read the tools.global.onlyAllow help in config.yml for details.
#    If the value is non-zero, it overwrites the .global. setting.
#    For the shovel we default to stone, dirt, grass, sand and gravel.
# 
# tools: shovel: stopOverwrite:  [ <id>, ...]
#    Read the tools.global.stopOverwrite help in config.yml.
#    If the value is non-zero, it overwrites the .global. setting.
