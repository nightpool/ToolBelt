# Here are the configuration descriptions for the paint tool
# 
# The "tools: bind:" and "tools: global: *:" settings are
#  specified in greater detail in the config.yml file
# 
# tools: paint: rangeDefault: <Number of blocks>
#    You can always grab a texture from a distance. Setting this
#    to a non-zero value allows users of the paint brush to also
#    paint a block from a distance. After a certain distance, it
#    is hard to be accurate. It is suggested to leave the number as
#    is and modify rangeCrouch. In order to use the paintbrush at
#    range, if permissions are enabled, as user must have:
#        toolbelt.tool.paint.range
# 
# tools: paint: rangeCrouch: <Number of blocks>
#    This follows the same rules as rangeDefault, including the use
#    of the same permission node. It is safer to have this at a non-
#    zero number as a user can only use this range while crouching.
#    This tries to force the user to specifically choose to paint
#    distant blocks. However both of these can be modified as wished.
# 
# tools: paint: onlyAllow:  <[]|[ <id>, ...]>
#    Read the tools.global.onlyAllow help in config.yml for details.
#    If the value is non-zero, it overwrites the .global. setting.
# 
# tools: paint: stopCopy:  [ <id>, ...]
#    Read the tools.global.stopCopy help in config.yml for details.
#    If the value is non-zero, it overwrites the .global. setting.
# 
# tools: paint: stopOverwrite:  [ <id>, ...]
#    Read the tools.global.stopOverwrite help in config.yml.
#    If the value is non-zero, it overwrites the .global. setting.
